<h1>Mahjong Direction</h1>
<h4>How to play-</h4>
Select tiles in matching sets untill all sets are removed from the board.<br>
<h4>Rules-</h4>
-Two tiles match if they are the same kind of tile and if their ranks are equal: <br>
For example, a Bamboo 6 tile matches any of the other three Bamboo 6 tiles, but it<br>
 does not match a Bamboo 5 nor a Circle 6. <br><br>
-Any two season tiles match as do any two flower tiles.
